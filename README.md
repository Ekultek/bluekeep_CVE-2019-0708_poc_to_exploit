Working shell codes when standalone. However you have to generate your own and customize it to suit your need. This is not some off-the-shelf exploits which you can just grab and check out.

Furthermore, the methods of delivery is also important to make sure your codes will execute on the remote machine.

So far we still aren't able to succesfully to pop a shell and achieved RCE; however, intensive research is being done in order understand the inner working of the vulnerability.
